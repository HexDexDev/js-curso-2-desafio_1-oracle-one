Console Button: A button that, when pressed, logs the message "The button was clicked" to the browser's console.
Alert Button: A button that triggers an alert with the message "I love JS".
Prompt Button: This button asks the user to enter the name of a city in Brazil. After the input, an alert is displayed with the message "I was in {city} and thought of you," where {city} is replaced by the name of the city entered by the user.
Sum Button: A button that requests two integers from the user and displays an alert with the sum of these numbers.
